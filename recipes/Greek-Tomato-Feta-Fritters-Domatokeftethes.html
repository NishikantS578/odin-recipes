        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            There are so many great ways to enjoy fresh, sweet summer tomatoes, and much to my shock and amazement, these Greek-style fritters could be my new favorite. This is a major surprise, since I generally don't enjoy large, hot chunks of fresh tomato in a recipe. I'm okay with them being cooking down, and disappearing into a sauce, but I find them texturally challenging when they remain intact. Unless they're inside a crispy, herb-and-cheese-studded, fried fritter. In that case, I can't get enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            This same basic idea can be used to enjoy pretty much any fresh, or frozen vegetables you like. Just make sure whatever you're mixing in will work with such as short cooking time, and if it won't, simply pre-cook it until tender, and proceed as shown. Above and beyond changing up the vegetable component(s), you can season and flavor these any way you want, so this recipe is a creative cook's dream. Having said all that, these were amazing made as is, so maybe try these first, and then add your own personal touches, but either way, I really hope you give these a try soon.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups diced fresh tomatoes with juices</li>
            <li>½ cup packed grated zucchini</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together tomatoes, zucchini, green onions, kosher salt, sugar, black pepper, oregano, and cayenne in a bowl to combine.</li>
            <li>Let sit for 15 minutes for the sugar and salt to draw out liquids from the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Stir the tomato mixture; add parsley, mint, and basil. Crumble in feta cheese. Add flour and baking powder; mix with a spoon until combined. Batter should be relatively loose but will hold its shape on a spoon. If too loose, add more flour; if too dry, add some water until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Wrap the bowl in plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or use a deep fryer.</li>
            <li>Place heaping tablespoonfuls of batter in the hot oil; reduce heat to medium. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Flip once more and fry for an additional 30 seconds, if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
